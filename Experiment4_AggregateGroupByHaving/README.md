# Experiment 4: Aggregate Functions, Group By and Having Clause

### Name   : Subbiah S
### Reg no : 212223220111

## AIM
To study and implement aggregate functions, GROUP BY, and HAVING clause with suitable examples.

## THEORY

### Aggregate Functions
These perform calculations on a set of values and return a single value.

- **MIN()** – Smallest value  
- **MAX()** – Largest value  
- **COUNT()** – Number of rows  
- **SUM()** – Total of values  
- **AVG()** – Average of values

**Syntax:**
```sql
SELECT AGG_FUNC(column_name) FROM table_name WHERE condition;
```
### GROUP BY
Groups records with the same values in specified columns.
**Syntax:**
```sql
SELECT column_name, AGG_FUNC(column_name)
FROM table_name
GROUP BY column_name;
```
### HAVING
Filters the grouped records based on aggregate conditions.
**Syntax:**
```sql
SELECT column_name, AGG_FUNC(column_name)
FROM table_name
GROUP BY column_name
HAVING condition;
```

**Question 1**
--
How many patients have expired insurance coverage for each insurance company?

Sample table:Insurance Table

```sql
SELECT
    InsuranceCompany,
    COUNT(*) AS TotalExpiredPatients
    FROM Insurance
    WHERE ValidityPeriod < CURRENT_DATE
    GROUP BY InsuranceCompany
```

**Output:**

FROM MedicalRecords 
GROUP BY Month
ORDER BY Month; 
```

```sql
SELECT
    city,
    SUM(income) AS 'Income'
FROM employee
GROUP BY city
HAVING SUM(income)>200000;
```

**Output:**

**Question 9**
---
Write the SQL query that achieves the grouping of data by age, calculates the minimum income for each age group, and includes only those age groups where the minimum income is less than 1,000,000.

    MIN(income) AS 'Income'
FROM employee
GROUP BY age
HAVING MIN(income)<1000000;
